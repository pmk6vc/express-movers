# express-movers

Marketplace for movers

TODO:

- Use Husky for precommits and add linting
- Update verify YAML and branch protections for prettier and linting checks
- If necessary, update GH Actions deploy script to use gcloud directly :(
- Simply docker-compose command by putting variables in root .env
